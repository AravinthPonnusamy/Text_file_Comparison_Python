Python is very powerful when it comes to do a file comparison 
Some tests i did
    - 1.5 gb file comparison takes 1.5 minutes
    - 130 mb files takes about 10 seconds

When i tried to run the python for 1.5 gb initially, i got a memory error
Upon investigation i found that python 32-bit for some reason limits itself to 4GB 
That much of memory is not enough, so i had to resinstall my python for 64 bit 
Note: When installing python add that to the environment variable path else 
it will not reflect when you try to check that from cmd prompt.

Clearly, python is ages ahead of the rest.
